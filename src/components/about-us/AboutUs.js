                                It all started with an idea.

                                We believe that if artists had one place to host their comics for free and with minimum stress, they would be proud to show off to their friends what they have created and eventually thousands of people will get to discover and appreciate their work.
                            </p>

                                We believe that when readers don't have to go through several Facebook pages or blogs to find awesome African themed action comic stories then the number of readers will double and triple.
                            </p>

                            <p style={{ color: 'white'}} >
                                We believe that the key to a thriving African comic industry is when artists and readers come together on the same platform to share creative energy.

                            <p style={{ color: 'white'}} >We believe that platform could be ComicWox.</p>

                            <p style={{ color: 'white'}} >We are willing to put that belief to the test.</p>
